abstract:
    This chapter will discuss briefly the state of the art related to the Planar Quads Meshes, and how they are implemented in architecture. Therefore we will show the solutions behind the available softwares and the different techniques related to variantes researches achieved within this topic in the last twenty years. In addition to that we will try to cover all the techniques, by implementing them using the available tools. In the end the results will be analyzed regarding the economical and aesthetical properties for constructable planar quadrilateral panels.
