# Construction
## PQ Geometric Properties
## Benefits
## Metrics-Measures(Quality)

# Algorithmic Strategies
## Several Pre-Processing Techniques
### Translational Surfaces
### Conical Meshes
### Circular Meshes
### Conjugate Networks

## Optimization (K2)goals
### Quad-Dominant Mesh(Optimize to a PQ mesh by imposing some properties)
### Subdivision Strategy (Starting with a Coarse Quad-Dominant mesh)
