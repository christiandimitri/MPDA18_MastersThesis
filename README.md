# MPDA18_MastersThesis

This is my master's thesis final project "Rationalization techniques for Planar Quad Meshes in architecture freeform surfaces"

I published my final results and the research paper using markdown and pandoc.
Thus the text and print quality is not edited.
All the algorithms and processes has been done using grasshopper3d and a series of custom plugin I found during my research.
The project will be updated in the future with more features (custom grasshopper3d plugins for PQ meshes and more)

Thank you and enjoy the results
